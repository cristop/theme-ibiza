                    <p class="text"> 
                        After purchasing your property - when the pre-agreement (contrato de arras) is signed and
                        corresponding funds are deposited - you will automatically qualify for a multiple entry Golden Visa.
                        This is valid for one year and is easily renewable on an annual basis while you maintain ownership
                        of at least €500,000 of real estate. Within that year, you must apply in person for the two-year
                        residence permit, again, provided that your investment made is still in place. <br><br>

                        The easiest and most reliable way to apply for a Golden Visa is through our Golden Visa Concierge
                        Service which will not only secure your application but also find you the perfect property. As we
                        are familiar with the system, we will be able to advise you and are usually able to help you move
                        through the process quickly and smoothly, which usually takes between four and eight weeks to
                        complete.
