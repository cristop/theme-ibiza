                                venerated and style and glamour are prerequisites. The name 'Ibiza' is derived from a
                                'Bes', a Carthaginian god of dance and of course the island has a roster of superclubs
                                of global repute. Yet nightlife is only one element of Ibiza's modern identity.</p>
                            <p>The ancient Greeks called Ibiza the 'island of pines' and its rural lanes have a timeless
                                allure, framed by forested hills and bordered by fields of olive and almond trees. With
                                enticingly turquoise waters and over fifty coves and beaches, the Ibizan coastline is an
                                aqua paradise which begs exploration. Then factor in an array of astonishing wellness
                                retreats and a world-class dining scene and it's easy to appreciate Ibiza's singular,
                                inimitable reputation.</p>

                        The North.
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text">
                        A rugged, sparsely-populated region of soaring pine-forested hills and secluded bays, the north
                        of Ibiza is defined by tranquility and tradition. Development is strictly regulated here, with
                        just a sprinkling of small, low-key beach resorts, no large urban centres and an heady excess of
                        stupendous natural scenery to savour. Each village, including delightful San Juan, has a
                        whitewashed church and an Ibicenco restaurant or two, while the dramatic, sparkling coastline is
                        dotted with family-run seafood places. Ravishing beaches like Benirras and Aquas Blancas boast
                        turquoise waters and mesmeric visions across the Med to craggy offshore islets. <br><br>

                        Gaze north on a very clear day and Mallorca is just visible. You’ll find ample scope for some
                        serious pampering in world-class spas, excellent horseriding and superb walking trails to
                        explore around Portinatx and Es Portixol. Back in the 1960s the rural North was Ibiza’s main
                        hippy hangout, and a sense of the island's bohemian identity endures to this day in the region's
                        art markets and laid-back character.

                        With the island’s highest peak, most cosmopolitan beaches and most enigmatic
                        sights, Southern Ibiza has it all. For raw natural beauty, the remarkable back-to-back sandy
                        bays of Salines and Es Cavallet are a dream, while the nearby cove of Cala Jondal has a roster
                        of renowned beach clubs where you can idle away hours weighing up the merits of a margarita or a
                        massage.
                        <br><br>
                        Exploring this region, there's a shimmering expanse of salt flats (particularly evocative at
                        sunset); the craggy, almost volcanic-looking offshore island of Es Vedra; and magical vision of
                        ‘Atlantis’, only accessible on foot (or yacht!). Village-wise, San Jose has an eclectic
                        selection of bars and cafes, while destination restaurants are dotted around the interior and
                        coastline. The South is also home to the airport and has fast road connections to Ibiza Town.

                        Santa Eulalia could just be the perfect Ibizan town: compact (so traffic and
                        parking are not really issues) yet developed enough to offer superb dining and good retail
                        options. Head down the pretty lane Calle San Vicente (known as the ‘Street of Restaurants’) or
                        over to the stunning marina district for excellent seafood choices set alongside gleaming
                        yachts. The town also has a historic hilltop church and a couple of sandy bays, but for better
                        beaches, the sands of Cala Llonga, Cala Pada and Cala Nova are more enticing and just a short
                        drive away.

                    <p class="text">
                        The West of the island is dominated by the lively resort town of San Antonio,
                        dubbed a clubbing capital by the European media, its Sunset Strip home to legendary bars. Yes,
                        this is the spot to toast the last of the day’s rays, as a fiery globe sets the San Antonio Bay
                        skies alight in a kaleidoscopic blaze of burnt oranges, impossible pinks and every shade of
                        rouge. Just beyond San Antonio, you’ll find the beautiful beaches of Cala Bassa and Cala Conta,
                        and if you investigate a little further, there’s a succession of exquisite coves including
                        Tarida, Vadella and Cala Codolar. The latter is home to Ibiza’s very own ‘Stonehenge’, a magical
                        art installation of huge basalt columns arranged in a circle by a remote rocky shore.

                    <p class="text">
                        The heart and soul of the island is characterised by its rust-red earth, blinding white churches
                        and traditional farmland. Principal villages include Santa Gertrudis, long-famous for its
                        orchards and local bars, but now also boasting an international school (very popular with
                        British parents as it follows the UK curriculum), pilates and yoga studios, galleries and design
                        boutiques. People-watching on this village’s quirky high street is second to none, as
                        billionaire boho characters (many musicians and artists settled here in the sixties and
                        seventies) and Ibicenco farmers mingle and chat. Santa Gertrudis has a family-friendly vibe
                        thanks to its excellent playground, sports facilities and accessibility to the rest of the
                        island - everywhere is within a half-hour drive. Nearby San Rafael, a hub of olive and almond
                        cultivation, also has something of a dual identity as it’s home to a couple of the island’s
                        clubbing temples as well as traditional restaurants and cafes.
